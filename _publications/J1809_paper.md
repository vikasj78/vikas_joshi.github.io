Our modelling indicates that based on the spectrum and spatial extent of HESS J1809-193, the extended H.E.S.S. component is likely caused by inverse
Compton emission from old electrons that form a halo around the pulsar wind nebula. The compact component could be connected to either the
pulsar wind nebula or the supernova remnant and molecular clouds. Due to its comparatively steep spectrum, modelling the Fermi-LAT emission
together with the H.E.S.S. components is not straightforward.
