About
======
I am a research (data) scientist with a demonstrated history of working in the research industry. I have worked with large datasets from several gamma-ray observatories with diverse international teams. My research background provides me with solid experience in deep learning, machine learning, statistical analysis, data analysis, data visualisation, Python and C++ programming, SQL, and high-performance computing. As a team player with solid research, supervision, problem-solving, communication, and writing skills, I always look forward to learning new technologies.

I am a staunch advocate for financial literacy and open dialogue. I enjoy cycling, playing cricket, and learning new things.
