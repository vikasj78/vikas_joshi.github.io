About
======
I am a physicist and data scientist with a demonstrated history of working in the research industry. I have worked with large datasets from several gamma-ray observatories, such as HESS, HAWC and SWGO, with diverse international teams. My research background provides me with solid experience in data analytics, data visualization, statistics, Python, machine learning models, and high-performance computing. As a team player with strong research, problem-solving, communication, and writing skills I always look forward to learning new technologies.

I am a stauch advocate for financial literacy and open dialogue. I enjoy cycling, playing cricket, and learning new things.
